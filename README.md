# Raspberry Pi Video Jukebox

This project is designed to take a Raspberry Pi 3 or later and use it as a video jukebox. Using bash scripting, onboard Raspberry PI video player, and a collection of MP4 movie files, the script will randomly play movies for a random duration. The inspiration for this project was a friend's bar, which would play movies while patrons were drinking. The downside of this approach is that if you didn't like the movie, it would be on for a few hours, so this approach adds some novelty to the mix. There are a few touches, like not playing the opening or closing credits using offsets, but otherwise this is a simple command line script that leverages the awesome capabilities of the Pi with an external hard drive. Enjoy!
